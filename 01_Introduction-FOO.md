# Introduction to Systematic Design of Multi-Component Systems

Dr Nawfal Al Hashimy

---

### Intended Learning Outcomes (ILO)

By the end of this lecture, students will be able to:

- Define systematic and systemic design in the context of multi-component systems.
    
- Identify the differences between monolithic and distributed design approaches.
    
- Describe the key phases of a systematic design process.
    
- Explain the importance of interfaces and coordination in distributed system development.
    
- Evaluate tools and methods used to support the systematic design of complex systems.
    
- Apply a systematic design process to a simplified real-world engineering problem.
